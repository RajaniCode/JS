2.7 Functionality in Functions

In order to add a bit of functionality to our Tour, let's pass in the nightly cost of the Tour when we create a new one - maybe 100 for now. In the Tour function, update the declaration to accept this new price argument.

In order to use this price, create a new function within the Tour named cost, which can be called with a number of nights. This cost function should console.log the number of nights multiplied by the price. We've added the call to cost within $(document).ready(), which you can uncomment once you've implemented.

HTML

<div id="tour" data-location="london">
  <button>Get Photos</button>
  <ul class="photos">

  </ul>
</div>

application.js

function Tour() {
  console.log("A new Tour was created");
}
$(document).ready(function() { 
  var tour = new Tour();
  //tour.cost(4);
});

Answer:

application.js

function Tour(price) {
    this.cost = function (nights) {
        console.log((price * nights));
    }
}

$(document).ready(function () {
    var tour = new Tour(100);
    tour.cost(4);
});
