1.7 DOM Ready

Great! Now we just have to make sure the code runs after the web page has finished loading (when the DOM is ready), go ahead and do that now.

HTML

<div class="homepage-wrapper">
  <h2>Welcome to jQuery Travels - Traversing the DOM since 2006</h2>
  <p>Fly to New York today for as little as <span>$299.99</span></p>
</div>

Answer:

$(document).ready(function() {
  $("span").text("$100"); 
});
