2.11 Nested Routes and Paths

With the current application route hierarchy:

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('polls', function() {
    this.route('poll', { path: '/:poll_id' });
  });
});

When the browser requests /polls, which route will be used?

[Single Answer]

The polls route
The polls/poll route
The polls/index route


Answer: The polls/index route

Note: The polls route is now a parent route and isn't directly navigable. Instead, there is a generated child route that'll be used.

Note: The polls/poll route would be used if the path had a poll_id defined (like /polls/123). Instead, it'll use a sibling route.
