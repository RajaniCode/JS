1.10 JSX and Plain JavaScript

Turns out robots are very knowledgeable in the subject of math, thanks to JavaScript! Let's see what they have to say about the value of PI.

components.js

class RobotTime extends React.Component {
  render() {
  	
    return (
      <div   >
        The value of PI is approximately 
      </div>
    );
  }
}
 
1. Before the return statement, create a new variable called pi and assign it the value of PI. In case you don't remember, you can use the built-in Math.PI property from JavaScript.

Answer:

components.js

class RobotTime extends React.Component {
  render() {
  	const pi = Math.PI;
    return (
      <div   >
        The value of PI is approximately 
      </div>
    );
  }
}

2. Reference the pi variable from inside the render() method so that the message returned by our component says: The value of PI is approximately 3.141592653589793.

Answer:

components.js

class RobotTime extends React.Component {
  render() {
  	const pi = Math.PI;
    return (
      <div   >
        The value of PI is approximately {pi}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

3. Lastly, add a CSS class to the component <div> called is-tasty-pie.

Answer:

components.js

class RobotTime extends React.Component {
  render() {
  	const pi = Math.PI;
    return (
      <div  className="is-tasty-pie">
        The value of PI is approximately {pi}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
