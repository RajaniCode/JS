If we were to craft a response sending a string of text with the response.send() function, just like the following code, what would Express set this Content-Type to?

  app.get('/locations', function(request, response) {
    var cities = '<ul><li>Caspiana</li><li>Indigo</li></ul>';
    response.send(cities);
  });

    text/plain

    text/html
