2.10 Buildings

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.use(function(request, response, next){
  if (request.path === "/cities"){
    next();
  } else {
    response.status(404).json("Path requested does not exist");
  }
});

app.get('/cities', function(request, response){
  var cities = ['Caspiana', 'Indigo', 'Paradise'];
  response.json(cities);
});

app.listen(3000);

When we run our previous code and issue a GET request to the /buildings endpoint, what will the response be?

    A successful response with ['Caspiana', 'Indigo', 'Paradise']

    An error

    A 404 response with 'Path requested does not exist'

Answer: A 404 response with 'Path requested does not exist'
