2.8 Add Logging Middleware

In the following code in app.js, we require our new middleware and assign it to a variable called logger.

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var logger = require('./logger');

//TODO: mount middleware

app.listen(3000);

What function should we call in order to mount the middleware and add it to the stack?

    app.route(logger)

    app.use(logger)

    app.mount(logger)

Answer: app.use(logger)
