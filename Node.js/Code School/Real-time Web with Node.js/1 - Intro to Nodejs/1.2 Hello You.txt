1.2 Hello You

Let's start with a simple Hello server. Follow the tasks below to create a simple Node server that outputs a greeting.


1. First, tell the response which status it should have (a successful status is 200).

Answer: response.writeHead(200);

app.js

var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
response.writeHead(200);
}).listen(8080);


2. Next, write a message to the response body in the form of "Hello, this is <your name here>".

Answer: response.write("Hello, this is Rajani");

app.js

var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
response.writeHead(200); 
response.write("Hello, this is Rajani");
}).listen(8080);

3. To finish it up, tell the response to end so the client on the other side knows it has received all the data.

Answer: response.write("Hello, this is Rajani");

app.js

var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
response.writeHead(200); 
response.write("Hello, this is Rajani");
response.end();
}).listen(8080);
