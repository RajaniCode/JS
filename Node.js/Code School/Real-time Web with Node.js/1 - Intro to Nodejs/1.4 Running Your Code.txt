1.4 Running Your Code

While you could go to the website and easily install node, we happen to have a console below where you can practice running node applications.

Go ahead and run that file we just created to read a file off the filesystem with
node file_read.js

Answer:  node file_read.js

Console:

Type help to see the help menu

$ help

The following commands are available:

    help - Displays the help menu
    hint - Displays a hint related to the error that you see
    next - Moves to the next challenge
    reset - Resets the challenge as if you refreshed the page

$ node file_read.js

<html><p>Hello, this is Dog</p></html>

Congratulations, you're correct!
