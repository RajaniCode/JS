4.2 Missing Exports

Notice the two different files: high_five.js on the left side and app.js on the right. The code as it's written will not work, high_five.js isn't exporting anything.

1. Add the proper exports line to have a successful high five!

Answer: module.exports = highfive;

high_five.js

var highfive = function() {
  console.log("smack!!");
};
module.exports = highfive;

app.js

var highfive = require('./high_five.js');
highfive();
