6.8 Answering Question Client

Now on the client, listen for the 'answer' event and then broadcast both the question and the answer to the connected clients.

1. Listen for the 'answer' event off of the server.

Answer: server.on('answer', function(question, answer){});

app.js

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  server.on('question', function(question) {
    insertQuestion(question);
  });
  server.on('answer', function(question, answer){});
  //Don't worry about these methods, just assume 
  //they insert the correct html into the DOM
  // var insertQuestion = function(question) {
  // }

  // var answerQuestion = function(question, answer) {
  // }
</script>

2. Call the answerQuestion function, passing in both the question and the answer that was broadcast from the server.

Answer: 

  server.on('answer', function(question, answer){
    answerQuestion(question, answer);
  });

app.js

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  server.on('question', function(question) {
    insertQuestion(question);
  });
  server.on('answer', function(question, answer){
    answerQuestion(question, answer);
  });
  //Don't worry about these methods, just assume 
  //they insert the correct html into the DOM
  // var insertQuestion = function(question) {
  // }

  // var answerQuestion = function(question, answer) {
  // }
</script>
