When these folks get on board, the new passenger count is reported to the conductor. Build a String called countMessage that uses numPassengers to say:

Attention: There are now 3 passengers on the train!

Remember, no hard-coding values!

var numPassengers = 0
numPassengers += 3

Answer:

var numPassengers = 0
numPassengers += 3
var countMessage = 'Attention: There are now ' + numPassengers + ' passengers on the train!';
