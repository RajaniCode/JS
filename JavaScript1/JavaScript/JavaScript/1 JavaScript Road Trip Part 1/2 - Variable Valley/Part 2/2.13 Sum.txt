2.13 Sum

To complete this challenge, you must use an assignment expression and the addition operator in a single statement.

    1. First, determine the three numbers to add together.
        The number of wheels on a tricycle.
        The number of events in a decathlon.
        The number of years depicted in “Seven Years in Tibet”.

    2. Next, create an expression that adds these numbers together to determine the sum.

    3. Now that we know the sum, let’s name our variable. The variable name must meet the following conditions:
        Begins with the sum spelled out as a word.
        Ends with the sum as a number.
        Contains only the sum as a word and sum as a number.

    4. Finally, write a statement that declares our variable using the name from Step 3 and assigns it to the expression from Step 2.
