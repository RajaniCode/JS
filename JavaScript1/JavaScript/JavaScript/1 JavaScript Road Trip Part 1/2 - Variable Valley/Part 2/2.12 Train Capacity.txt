2.12 Train Capacity

Now, a person gets off the train at the Yellowstone National Park station.

    1. Build a trainCapacity variable and set it to 60.
    2. Decrement your numPassengers variable using the simple decrement syntax.
    3. Construct a String called occupancy in the following format:

2 passengers present, with 58 seats remaining.

In creating this String, use only your numPassengers and trainCapacity variables to create the numerical values.

var numPassengers = 0
numPassengers += 3

Answer: 

var numPassengers = 0
numPassengers += 3
var trainCapacity = 60;
numPassengers--;
var occupancy = numPassengers + ' passengers present, with ' + (trainCapacity - numPassengers) + ' seats remaining.';
