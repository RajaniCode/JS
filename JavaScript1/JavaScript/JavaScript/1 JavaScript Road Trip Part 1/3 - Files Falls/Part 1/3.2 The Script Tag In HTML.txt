3.2 The Script Tag In HTML

In the index.html file, add a <script> tag inside the <head> section to tell our HTML file that we want to execute some JavaScript code.

Call your JavaScript file oldFaithful.js. Assume that your .js file is in the same folder as your index.html file.

index.html

<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the JavaScript Express!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Answer: <script type="text/javascript" src="oldFaithful.js"></script>

For HTML 4.x, the type attribute is required. (W3):

This attribute specifies the scripting language of the element's contents and overrides the default scripting language. The scripting language is specified as a content type (e.g., "text/javascript"). Authors must supply a value for this attribute. There is no default value for this attribute.

For HTML 5, it is optional. If it is not specified, it defaults to text/javascript. (W3):

The type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The charset parameter must not be specified. The default, which is used if the attribute is absent, is "text/javascript".
