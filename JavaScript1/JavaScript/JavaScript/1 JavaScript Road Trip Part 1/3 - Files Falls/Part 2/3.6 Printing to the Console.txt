In the oldFaithful.js file, write a single statement that prints the following string to the browser console using string concatenation and the existing variables to produce the correct format:

"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park
Average eruption height today: 145
Number of eruptions: 4

Answer:

console.log('"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park' + '\n' +
'Average eruption height today: ' + avgHeight + '\n' +
'Number of eruptions: ' + numEruptions);

oldFaithful.js

var avgHeight = 145;
var numEruptions = 4;
console.log('"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park' + '\n' +
'Average eruption height today: ' + avgHeight + '\n' +
'Number of eruptions: ' + numEruptions);
