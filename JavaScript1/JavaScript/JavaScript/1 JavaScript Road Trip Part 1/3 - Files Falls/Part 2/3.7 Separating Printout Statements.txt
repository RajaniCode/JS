3.7 Separating Printout Statements

Now, let’s say that Old Faithful’s eruptions are kept as separate variables, as you can see in the oldFaithful.js file.

Print the message below to the console using the existing variable names to access all values in the printout. Additionally, use one console.log() statement per line of the output.

We’ve also given you a variable name for the average; but to succeed at this challenge, you’ll need to think of how to calculate the average using only the variable names and operation syntax.

< and > indicate where our variable’s actual value should be placed. There should be no < > in your output, however. Be attentive to spacing as well.

"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park
Eruption 1: <first eruption amount goes here>
Eruption 2: <second eruption amount goes here>
Eruption 3: <third eruption amount goes here>
Average eruption height today: <average value goes here>

Answer:

var avg = (eruption1 + eruption2 + eruption3) / numEruptions;
console.log('"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park');
console.log('Eruption 1: ' + eruption1);
console.log('Eruption 2: ' + eruption2);
console.log('Eruption 3: ' + eruption3);
console.log('Average eruption height today: ' + avg);


oldFaithful.js

var eruption1 = 112;
var eruption2 = 148;
var eruption3 = 160;
var numEruptions = 3;
var avg = (eruption1 + eruption2 + eruption3) / numEruptions;
console.log('"Old Faithful" at Yellowstone National Park');
console.log('Eruption 1: ' + eruption1);
console.log('Eruption 2: ' + eruption2);
console.log('Eruption 3: ' + eruption3);
console.log('Average eruption height today: ' + avg);
