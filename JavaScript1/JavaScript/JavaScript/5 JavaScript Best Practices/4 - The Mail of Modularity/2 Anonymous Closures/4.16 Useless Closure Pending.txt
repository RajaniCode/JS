4.16 Useless Closure Pending

var CAVESOFCLARITY = function () {

  var treasureChests = 3;
  var bats = 345;

  return {
    stalactites: 4235,
    stalagmites: 3924,
    openChest: function () {
        treasureChests--;
        alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
    }
  };
}();

    Though you have effectively made the number of bats private, I wonder if you can see the problem that has ensued.

Aiedra waits patiently for your analysis. What happened?

    With multiple variable declarations, the public properties are now unable to access any private properties.

    Because of hoisting, the object is returned before the closure can be built.

    The data is no longer present within the closure because it is never used.

    Since it's never referenced through the public methods, the private bats datum holds no functional purpose.

Answer: Since it's never referenced through the public methods, the private bats datum holds no functional purpose.
