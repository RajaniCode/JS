4.27 Private State Access Pending

When you finish augmenting the CAVESOFCLARITY module, a short railing, square and wooden, rises up from the rocky ground. Inside the railing, a thick carpet of white sand creates a sort of sandbox. A round button appears in the floor, just outside the railing. It pulses with green light.

You press the button and the sand in the small sandbox begins to shift and mold under some invisible force. The grains coalesce, part, and dance slowly into a familiar script. The sand-writing reveals broken phrases. In the dim light of the torch, you know what you must do.
