4.7 Treasure Chests

The Caves need slightly better protection for their treasureChests. Use your knowledge of things that are 'nested' to build a new container within your existing container. To it, you should add the treasureChests variable, and the method which accompanies the opening of these chests. You may call this container SECRET.

cavesofclarity.js

var CAVESOFCLARITY = {
  stalactites: 4235,
  stalagmites: 3924,
  bats: 345,
  treasureChests: 3,
  openChest: function() {
    this.treasureChests--;
    alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
  }
};

Answer:

   SECRET: {
  	treasureChests: 3,
    openChest: function() {
    this.treasureChests--;
    alert("DA DADADA DAAAAAAA!");
  	}
    }
