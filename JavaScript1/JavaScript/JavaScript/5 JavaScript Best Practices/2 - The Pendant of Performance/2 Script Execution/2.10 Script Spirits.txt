2.10 Script Spirits

Script spirits have placed a magic lock on the position of the script tag in the nearby file, and as soon as you try to move it, it pops right back into place.

A low murmur comes from the Script spirits, clearly a mocking sound.

Modify the tag without moving it, in order to allow the page to continue to load without too much delay.
