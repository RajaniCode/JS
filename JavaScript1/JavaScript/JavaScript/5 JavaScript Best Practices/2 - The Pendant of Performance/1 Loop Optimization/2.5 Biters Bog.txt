The critters confer with Aeidra in the shadows. She floats back to you through the quiet mist.

    "It seems the critters have only one use for that cache variable you've built: that single loop itself. They've asked you to relocate the cache so that it will be found nearer to where it is used. Thus will clarity ensue."

var bitersBog = {
  critters: ["Nipping Global Variable", 
             "Sneaky For-in",

};

populationGetter(bitersBog); 

function populationGetter( location ){
  var list = "";
  var numCritters = location.critters.length;
  for(var i = 0, ; i < numCritters; i++){
    list += location.critters[i];

}

Answer: for(var i = 0, numCritters = location.critters.length; i < numCritters; i++){
