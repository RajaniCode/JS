1.18 Dhuun Doppelganger

In another time, in another world, a very different Dhuun meets such a trial once more. In this alternate drama, what happened? Look closely.

var strength = true;
var fear = true;
var pack = {
  food: [ "carrot",
          "mystery meat",
          "apple",
          "crust of bread",
          "spicy dried sausage",
          "carrot",
          "wedge of sharp cheese",
          "jug of milk",
          "mystery meat",
          "carrot"
        ],
  addFood: function(foodItem){
    this.food = this.food || [];
    this.food.push(foodItem);
  },
  enoughFood:function(amount){
    return(this.food.length >= amount);
  }
};

var surviveThisTrial = strength && !fear && pack.enoughFood(10);


Answer: The fear variable will short-circuit the logical assignment, and enoughFood will not be called at all. Dhuun falls.
