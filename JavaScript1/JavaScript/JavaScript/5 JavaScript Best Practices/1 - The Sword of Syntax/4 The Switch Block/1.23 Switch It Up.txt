1.23 Switch It Up

You've entered the airy mystery of the Sans Temple in search of the final Lamp of Legibility. A caretaker approaches Aiedra and confers softly in the shadow. She returns to you with a request from the temple's attendants.

    "The temple's caretakers find their directional function a bit tedious and processor-intensive. switch it up, won't you? Replace the if-else blocks with a switch block that uses an excellent case statement for EACH one of the possible direction values. And Dhuun…don't forget to break!"

  var happensNext;
    if(direction == "right hallway") {
      happensNext = "You find a door, it is locked. You head back from where you came."
    } else if(direction == "left hallway") {
      happensNext = "You find a door, it is locked. You head back from where you came."
    } else if(direction == "forward hallway") {
      happensNext = "You find a door, it is locked. You head back from where you came."
    } else if(direction == "lower tunnel") {
      happensNext = "You find a door, it is locked. You head back from where you came."
    } else if(direction == "hidden door") {
      happensNext = "You go through the door into a room. A small, very dark room, that smells of dust and sulfur..."
    } else {
      happensNext = "You stand there, gaping, not moving. Aiedra wonders, are you alive?"
