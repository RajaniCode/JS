3.12 Fowl Feeding Fun

Having seen the wonderous array of birds inhabiting the dunes, you wish to feed them…but your bird feeding attempt was stopped by bothersome line #7 when you entered it into the console.

function Bird(){}
function DatatypeBird(){...}
function SyntaxBird(){...}
DatatypeBird.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
SyntaxBird.prototype   = Object.create(Bird.prototype);

TryCatchTaster.prototype = Object.create(SyntaxBird.prototype);

var NumberNommer = function(){...};

NumberNommer.prototype = Object.create(DatatypeBird.prototype);

var duneInhabitants = [NumberNommer, StringSeeker, TryCatchTaster, 
                       SwitchSnagger, TernaryTracker, BooleanBiter];

// for birds inhabiting the dunes, call feedBird()
