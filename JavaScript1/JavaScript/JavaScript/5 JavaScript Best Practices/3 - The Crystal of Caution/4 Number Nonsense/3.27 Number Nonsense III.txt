3.27 Number Nonsense III

But what if the lambs could change and morph? Get the exact number of all lambs using a single function call. Don't forget any lamb bits!

var lambString = "57.98 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.";

Answer: parseFloat("57.98 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.", 10);

Note: radix argument only from 2-36

Console:

> parseFloat("57.98 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.", 10);

57.98

Congratulations, you're correct!
