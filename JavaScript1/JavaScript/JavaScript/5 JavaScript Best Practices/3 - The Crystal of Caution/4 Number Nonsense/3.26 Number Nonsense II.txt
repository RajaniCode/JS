3.26 Number Nonsense II

Get the number of whole lambs from the following string using a single method call.

var lambString = "57 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.";

Answer: parseInt("57 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.", 10);

Note: radix argument only from 2-36

Console:

> parseInt("57 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.");

57

It's considered best practice to always pass the radix argument to parseInt(string, radix).

> parseInt("57 lazy lambs do bask in the sun.", 10);

57

Congratulations, you're correct!
