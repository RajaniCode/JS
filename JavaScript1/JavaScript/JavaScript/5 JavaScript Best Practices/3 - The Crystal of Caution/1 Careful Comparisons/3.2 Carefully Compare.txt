3.2 Carefully Compare

Aiedra indicates the file for a nearby BooleanBiter bird. The poor critter wanders aimlessly, appearing to need some help in retrieving the right sort of food.

var nearbyFood = [1, 4, true, "true", false, "0"];
function eatBoolean( food ){
  var x = food.length;
  for( var i = 0; i<x; i++){
    if( // Here, the bird needs a condition to check // ){
      alert("Yummo. Chirp!");
      nearbyFood.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
}

When this BooleanBiter's file searches for Boolean values in unknown "food" environments, which comparator should be involved in the condition that is missing above?

===

==

instanceof
