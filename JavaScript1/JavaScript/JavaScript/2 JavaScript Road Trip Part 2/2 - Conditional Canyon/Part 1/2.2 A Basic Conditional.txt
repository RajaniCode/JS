2.2 A Basic Conditional

In countdown.js, modify the while loop with a conditional that will only allow a number to be printed if it is even. Your results should be the even numbers from 10 to 2 in descending order. Think carefully about how your code might decide if a number is even…

countdown.js

var num = 10;

while (num > 0) {

    console.log(num);

  num--;
}

Answer:

countdown.js

var num = 10;
while (num > 0) {
  if(num % 2 == 0) {
    console.log(num);
  }
  num--;
}
