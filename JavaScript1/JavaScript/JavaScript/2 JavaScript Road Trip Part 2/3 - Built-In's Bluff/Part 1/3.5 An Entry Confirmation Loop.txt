3.5 An Entry Confirmation Loop

We’ve learned to prompt the user for their age, and then confirm that their age has been entered correctly. Now we can use a while loop to improve the way this works.

Create a while loop that will continue to execute as long as the user has not entered the correct age. Inside the loop, provide a confirmation that the age has been entered correctly:

"You entered <age>. Is this correct?"

If that confirmation statement is correct, then set ageIsCorrect to true and alert the following message:

"Great! Your age is logged as <age>."

Otherwise, the loop should continue to prompt a user to enter their age and assign that value to the userAge variable:

"What's your age, user?"

userProfile.js

var userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
var ageIsCorrect = false;

Answer:

userProfile.js

var userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
var ageIsCorrect = prompt("You entered " + userAge + " . Is this correct?");
ageIsCorrect = confirm("Great! Your age is logged as " + userAge);
while(false === ageIsCorrect) {
  userAge =  prompt("What's your age, user?");
  ageIsCorrect = prompt("You entered " + userAge + " . Is this correct?");
	ageIsCorrect = confirm("Great! Your age is logged as " + userAge);
};
