2.7 Building a Closure II

The Dev Girls admire your closure mastery. To test your might, they’ve asked you to modify the warningMaker function in order to announce:

    The number of obstacles
    The specific location of the obstacle found

In other words, they want to pass a specific number and a specific location to the function, and have those values become part of the alert message for the obstacle being passed into the warningMaker function.

Update the warningMaker function so that it follows the format below. Use the parameters you create to take the names of the bracketed placeholders:

Beware! There have been <obstacle> sightings in the Cove today!
<number> have been spotted at the <location>!

Note: Pay close attention to whitespace! You do not need to call the warningMaker function.

obstacleWarnings.js

function warningMaker(obstacle) {
  return function() { // set parameters
    alert("Beware! There have been " + obstacle +
          " sightings in the Cove today!\n" +
          // finish the warning message here

    );
  };
}

Answer:

obstacleWarnings.js

function warningMaker(obstacle) {
    return function(number, location) { // set parameters
        alert("Beware! There have been " + obstacle +
                " sightings in the Cove today!\n" +
                // finish the warning message here
                number + " have been spotted at the " + location + "!");
    };
}
