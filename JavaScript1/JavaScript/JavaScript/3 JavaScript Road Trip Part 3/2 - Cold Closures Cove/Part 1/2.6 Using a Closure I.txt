2.6 Using a Closure I

The Cove’s Dev Girls just got reports of icebergs in the area!

    Build a warning message by passing a "iceberg" obstacle as an argument into the warningMaker function.
    Store the results in a new variable called icebergAlert.
    Call the icebergAlert function to view the warning message.

Note: You do not need to change the existing warningMaker function.

obstacleWarnings.js

function warningMaker(obstacle) {
  return function() {
    alert("Beware! There have been " + obstacle + " sightings in the Cove today!");
  };
}

// build your warning message here


Answer:

// build your warning message here
var icebergAlert = warningMaker("iceberg");
icebergAlert();

obstacleWarnings.js

function warningMaker(obstacle) {
  return function() {
    alert("Beware! There have been " + obstacle + " sightings in the Cove today!");
  };
}

// build your warning message here
var icebergAlert = warningMaker("iceberg");
icebergAlert();
