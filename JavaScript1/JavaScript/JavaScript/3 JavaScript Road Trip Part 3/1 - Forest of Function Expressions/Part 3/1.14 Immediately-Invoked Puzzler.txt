1.14 Immediately-Invoked Puzzler

Now the Poplar Puzzle-makers have sent you a puzzle with a new set of functions to use on that puzzle. To display your overwhelming array and function expression mastery, alert the answer to the following question:

    “What is obtained when the result of passing 9 into the fourth function of the puzzlers array is then passed into the function whose array index matches the result of passing 3 into the second function of the puzzlers array?”

To really impress them, the expression used in your alert should:

    1. Use just one line of code.
    2. Involve no manual calculation or hard-coded math on your part.
    3. Use indices of arrays to access functions.
    4. Use parentheses to pass in parameters to immediately-invoking functions.

popularPuzzlers.js

var puzzlers = [
  function(a) { return 8 * a - 10; },
  function(a) { return (a - 3) * (a - 3) * (a - 3); },
  function(a) { return a * a + 4; },
  function(a) { return a % 5; }
];


Answer:

alert(puzzlers[puzzlers[1](3)](puzzlers[3](9)));

// puzzlers[3](9) = 4 //Parameter

// puzzlers[1](3) = 0 //Index

//puzzlers[0]();
