4.9 Man your Bulb Stations!

We need to assign each of the ranger-devs to a super-blinding light bulb based on their station number. So we’re building a function that creates an alert message for the ranger-devs in the following format:

Avast, me hearties!
There be Pirates nearby! Stations!
<name>, man the <superblinder>!
<name>, man the <superblinder>!
<name>, man the <superblinder>!

We’ve created a dontPanic function for you that already contains the alert message. Your job is to finish building the list string:

    Create a for loop to loop through all of the rangers at the location, using the numRangers property to keep track.
    Inside the loop, begin by using the correct property to append the name of the current ranger to the list.
    Also, concatenate the text between the ranger name and the superblinder so that it matches the format above.
    Lastly, add the name of the correct super-blinding light bulb from the weaponBulbs array to the list. In order to retrieve the name of the correct bulb, you’ll need to use the ranger’s station number.

var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthouseRock = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 3,
  ranger1: {name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2},
  ranger2: {name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3},
  ranger3: {name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1}
};

function dontPanic(location) {
  var list = "Avast, me hearties!\n" +
             "There be Pirates nearby! Stations!\n";

  // loop through the rangers and append to list
  

  alert(list);
}

dontPanic(lighthouseRock);

Answer:

list += location["ranger" + eval("i + 1")].name + ", man the " + location.weaponBulbs[location["ranger" + eval("i + 1")].station - 1][0] + "!\n";

//Note
//list += location["ranger" + eval("i + 1")].name + ", man the " + location.weaponBulbs[i][0] + "!\n";

//Note
//list += eval("location.ranger" + eval("i + 1")).name + ", man the " + location.weaponBulbs[i][0] + "!\n";
