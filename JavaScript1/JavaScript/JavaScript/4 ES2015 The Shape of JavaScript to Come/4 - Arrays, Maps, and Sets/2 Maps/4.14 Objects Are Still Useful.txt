4.14 Objects Are Still Useful


In the code below, is it appropriate to use a JavaScript object as a map?

const USERS_PER_PAGE = 10;

let pageSettings = {
  perPage:  USERS_PER_PAGE,
  canSort:  false
};

[Single Answer]

Yes. Since keys like perPage and canSort are previously defined, we don't run the risk of accidentally overwriting values.
No. We should always use maps and never ever use objects again. Ever.


Answer: Yes. Since keys like perPage and canSort are previously defined, we don't run the risk of accidentally overwriting values.
