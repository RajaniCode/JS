let author1 = { name: "Sam" };
let author2 = { name: "Tyler" };

let totalReplies = ;

console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author1)}` );
console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author2)}` );


1. First, create a new Map object and assign it to the totalReplies variable.

Answer:

total-replies.js

let author1 = { name: "Sam" };
let author2 = { name: "Tyler" };

let totalReplies = new Map();

console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author1)}` );
console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author2)}` );

2. Using the set() method, add an entry in the totalReplies Map for the author1 object with the value of 42.

Answer:

total-replies.js

let author1 = { name: "Sam" };
let author2 = { name: "Tyler" };

let totalReplies = new Map();
totalReplies.set(author1, 42);

console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author1)}` );
console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author2)}` );

3. Finally, add an entry in the totalReplies Map for the author2 object with the value of 15.

Answer:

total-replies.js

let author1 = { name: "Sam" };
let author2 = { name: "Tyler" };

let totalReplies = new Map();
totalReplies.set(author1, 42);
totalReplies.set(author2, 15);

console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author1)}` );
console.log( `Total Replies: ${totalReplies.get(author2)}` );
