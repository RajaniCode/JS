In the code below, we are not using the most appropriate data structure. What’s wrong with this code?


let recentPosts = {};

getPost(postId, (data) => {
  recentPosts[data.author] = data.title;
});

The recentPosts variable should be declared with var instead of let.
recentPosts should be a Map, since keys are unknown until runtime.
