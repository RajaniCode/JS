2.2 Fixing Undefined Arguments


The function displayTopicsPreview() raises an error on the very first line when called with no arguments. Let's fix that!

display-topics-preview.js

function displayTopicsPreview( topics ){
  var message = "There are currently " + topics.length;
  _displayPreviewMessage(topics, message);
}


1. Set an empty array as the default value for the topics parameter.

Answer:

display-topics-preview.js

function displayTopicsPreview( topics = [ ] ){
  var message = "There are currently " + topics.length;
  _displayPreviewMessage(topics, message);
}

2. There's no reason why we should still use var, so let's replace that with let.

Answer:

display-topics-preview.js

function displayTopicsPreview( topics = [ ] ){
  let message = "There are currently " + topics.length;
  _displayPreviewMessage(topics, message);
}
