Question: Is there any workaround to rethrow an exception and preserve the stacktrace in Javascript?

I know that Chrome has a known bug [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60240] not preserving the stacktrace when rethrowing an exception in Javascript.

I have the following code running in Chrome:

try {
    try {
      runCodeThatMayThrowAnException();
    } catch (e) {
        // I'm handing the exception here (displaying a nice message or whatever)
        // Now I want to rethrow the exception
        throw (e);
    }
} catch (e) {
    // The stacktrace was lost here :(
}

Is there any way to keep the stacktrace? A jQuery plug-in maybe? Any workaround or ideas?

Answer:

In the final catch block try

    throw e.stack;

And I mean the very last one (the one going to the browser). If you nest your try/catch deeper, you'd need to change your previous throws.

function throwError() {
    var test = _undefined.propertyAccess;
}

try {
    try {
        try {
            throwError();
        } catch (e) {
            alert("exception: " + e.stack);
            throw e;
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e.stack);
        throw e;
    }
} catch (e) {
    throw e.stack;
}

What an odd bug.
