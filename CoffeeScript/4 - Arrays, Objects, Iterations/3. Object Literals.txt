Object Literals

Create a variable named coffee which is an object with a name property set to 'Russian', a level property set to 2 and an isRussian property which holds a function that returns true. Use an object literal.

Answer:

CoffeeScript:
coffee = {name:'Russian', level: 2, isRussian: -> true}

JavaScript:
var coffee;
coffee = {
  name: 'Russian',
  level: 2,
  isRussian: function() {
    return true;
  }
};
