Classes - Part I

Create a Coffee class that will produce coffee objects. In that class, create a constructor that takes name and level as arguments and sets them as instance variables. Also, make sure you create a function called isRussian.

CoffeeScript:
coffee =
  name: 'Russian'
  level: 2
  isRussian: -> @name is 'Russian'

JavaScript:
var coffee;
coffee = {
  name: 'Russian',
  level: 2,
  isRussian: function() {
    return this.name === 'Russian';
  }
};

Answer:

CoffeeScript:
class Coffee
  constructor: (@name = 'Russian', @level = 2) ->
  isRussian: -> @name is 'Russian'

JavaScript:
var Coffee;
Coffee = (function() {
  function Coffee(name, level) {
    this.name = name != null ? name : 'Russian';
    this.level = level != null ? level : 2;
  }
  Coffee.prototype.isRussian = function() {
    return this.name === 'Russian';
  };
  return Coffee;
})();
