Parse II


Great! Now let's take care of that pesky spelling error.

Change 'cankelled' to 'cancelled' and make sure to remove the 'cankelled' property.

Make sure to refer to the JSON below and to the right.

JSON RESPONSE

// Get /appointments/1
{ "appointment": { "title": "Ms. Kitty Hairball Treatment", "cankelled": false, "identifier": 1 }

APPLICATION.JS

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  parse: function(response){
    return response.appointment;
  }
});

Answer:

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  parse: function(response){
    response = response.appointment;
    response.cancelled = response.cankelled;
    delete response.cankelled;
    return response;
  }
});
