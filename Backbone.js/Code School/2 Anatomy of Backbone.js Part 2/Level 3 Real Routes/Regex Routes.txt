Regex Routes


Rewrite the show route to only accept numeric input for the id parameter. You'll have to add the initialize function to the AppRouter and use a regular expression.

APPLICATION.JS

var AppRouter = new (Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "appointments/:id":  "show"
  },
  show: function(id){
    var appointment = new Appointment({id: id});
    console.log(appointment);
  }
}));

Answer:

var AppRouter = new (Backbone.Router.extend({
  initialize: function(){
    this.route(/^appointments\/(\d+)$/, 'show');
  },
  show: function(id){
    var appointment = new Appointment({id: id});
    console.log(appointment);
  }
}));
