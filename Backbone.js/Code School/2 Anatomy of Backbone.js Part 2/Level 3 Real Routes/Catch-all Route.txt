Catch-all Route


Just in case people fiddle around with the URL let's add a catch-all route to our router that will log out to the console. Make sure the catch-all route comes last.

APPLICATION.JS

var AppRouter = new (Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "appointments/:id":  "show"
  },
  show: function(id){
    var appointment = new Appointment({id: id});
    console.log(appointment);
  }
}));

Answer:

var AppRouter = new (Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "appointments/:id":  "show",
    "*id":  "notFound"
  },
  show: function(id){
    var appointment = new Appointment({id: id});
    console.log(appointment);
  },
  notFound: function(id) {
    console.log('Sorry! There is no content here.');
  }
}));
