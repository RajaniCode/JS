App View


Turn the AppointmentApp object into a Backbone view instance. That means that you'll have to immediately instantiate the Backbone.View class returned by Backbone.View.extend().

APPLICATION.JS

var AppointmentApp = {
  Collections: {},
  Models: {},
  Views: {}
}

Answer:

var AppointmentApp = new (Backbone.View.extend({
  Collections: {},
  Models: {},
  Views: {}
}))();
