Sorting Order


Dr. Goodparts just sent us this email "Love the new sorting, but please flip it and reverse it", Update the comparator below to sort by date in reverse order

EXAMPLE

var app1 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-01"});
var app2 = new Appointment({date: "2013-02-01"});
var app3 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-15"});
var app4 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-09"});
var appointments = new Appointments();
appointments.add(app1);
appointments.add(app2);
appointments.add(app3);
appointments.add(app4);

APPLICATION.JS

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  comparator: 'date'
});

Answer:

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  comparator: function(app1, app2) {
    return app1.get('date') < app2.get('date');
  }
});
