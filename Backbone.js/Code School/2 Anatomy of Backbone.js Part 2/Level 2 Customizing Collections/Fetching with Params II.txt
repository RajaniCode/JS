Fetching with Params II
250

We can limit the number of appointments returned by passing in a per_page parameter also. Go ahead and construct the fetch call below to create a URL that looks like /appointments?since=2013-01-01&per_page=10

JSON RESPONSE

// Get /appointments
{
  "per_page": 10, "page": 1, "total": 50,
  "appointments": [
    { "title": "Ms. Kitty Hairball Treatment", "cankelled": false, "identifier": 1 }
  ]
}

APPLICATION.JS

var appointments = new Appointments();
appointments.fetch({data: {since: "2013-01-01"}});

Answer:

var appointments = new Appointments();
appointments.fetch({data: {since: "2013-01-01", per_page: 10}});
