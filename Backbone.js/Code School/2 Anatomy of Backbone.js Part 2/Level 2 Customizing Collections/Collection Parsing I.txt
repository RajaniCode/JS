Collection Parsing I


The server team is at it again, but this time they at least have a good reason: they want to start paginating appointments instead of just returning all of them when we fetch the Appointments collection. No problem. We've been here before. Take a look at the JSON the server is responding with below, and then modify the parse function to set properties on the collection instance for per_page, total, and page.

JSON RESPONSE

// Get /appointments
{
  "per_page": 10, "page": 1, "total": 50,
  "appointments": [
    { "title": "Ms. Kitty Hairball Treatment", "cankelled": false, "identifier": 1 }
  ]
}

APPLICATION.JS

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  parse: function(response){
    return response;
  }
});

Answer:

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  parse: function(response){
    this.perPage = response.per_page;
	this.page = response.page;
	this.total = response.total;
    return response.appointments;
  }
});
