Sorting by Date


Our appointments are being rendered in a pretty haphazard way. Dr. Goodparts is very chronological, so we need to always have our appointments sorted by the date. Add the code below to accomplish this.

EXAMPLE

var app1 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-01"});
var app2 = new Appointment({date: "2013-02-01"});
var app3 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-15"});
var app4 = new Appointment({date: "2013-01-09"});
var appointments = new Appointments();
appointments.add(app1);
appointments.add(app2);
appointments.add(app3);
appointments.add(app4);

APPLICATION.JS

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({});

Answer:

var Appointments = Backbone.Collection.extend({
	comparator: 'date'
});
