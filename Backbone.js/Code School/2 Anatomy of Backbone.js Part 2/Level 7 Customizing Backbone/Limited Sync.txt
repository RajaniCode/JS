Limited Sync


Dr. Goodparts has instituted a new (possibly controversial) policy: Appointments can not be changed. The office can create appointments, but they will no longer be able to update them or delete them.

To comply with this new policy, modify the Appointment model's sync function below to only work on read and create, but not on delete and update.

APPLICATION.JS

App.Models.Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  sync: function(method, model, options){
    Backbone.sync(method, model, options);    
  }
});

Answer:

App.Models.Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  sync: function(method, model, options){
    if (method === "read" || method === "create"){
      Backbone.sync(method, model, options); 
    }
  }
});
