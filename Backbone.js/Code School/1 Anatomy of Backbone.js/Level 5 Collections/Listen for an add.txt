Listen for an add


Dr. Goodparts has been adding models to the collection willy-nilly and you'd like to know when he does.

Use an event listener to log to the console the model's title anytime a model is added to the appointments collection.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});

APPLICATION.JS

var appointments = new AppointmentList();

Answer:

var appointments = new AppointmentList();
appointments.on('add', function(appointmentItem){
  console.log(appointmentItem.get('title'));
});
