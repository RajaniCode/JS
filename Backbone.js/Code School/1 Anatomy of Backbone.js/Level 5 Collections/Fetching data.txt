Fetching data


We totally forgot about the server! Instead of using reset, let's just fetch the data from the server. Set the url of AppointmentList collection to /appointments and then use fetch on the collection instance.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

APPLICATION.JS

var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});
var appointments = new AppointmentList();

Answer:

var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  url: '/appointments'
});
var appointments = new AppointmentList();
appointments.fetch();

//Note:
var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment,
  url: '/appointments'
});
var appointments = new AppointmentList();
appointments.fetch();
