Reset event


This Dr. Goodparts does not trust us when we tell him we are successfully loading data from the server into our collection.

To prove him wrong, display an alert with the number of items in the collection by listening for the reset event.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});

APPLICATION.JS

var appointments = new AppointmentList();
appointments.fetch();

Answer:

var appointments = new AppointmentList();
appointments.fetch();
appointments.on('reset', function(){
	alert(appointments.length);
});
