Fetch silently


Wouldn't ya know, our users don't like getting alerts every time we fetch new data for our collection.

Update the fetch call below to not fire the reset event.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});
var appointments = new AppointmentList();

APPLICATION.JS

appointments.fetch();

Answer: appointments.fetch({silent: true});
