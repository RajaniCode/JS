Collection Class


Dr. Goodparts is losing a ton of business because his app can only handle one appointment at a time! Who thought that was a good idea?

Let's start improving the situation. Define a new collection class called AppointmentList, and make sure it handles the Appointment model.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

APPLICATION.JS

var AppointmentList;

Answer:

var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});
