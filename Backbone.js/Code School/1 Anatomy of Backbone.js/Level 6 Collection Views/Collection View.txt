Collection View


It's finally time to start building out our Appointment app. We're going to be using a collection and a collection view to display a list of appointments to the ornery but brilliant Dr. Goodparts.

Let's start by creating a View Class named AppointmentListView and then create an instance of that class, passing in our collection instance appointments

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
 
var AppointmentList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Appointment
});

APPLICATION.JS

var appointments = new AppointmentList();

Answer:

var appointments = new AppointmentList();
var AppointmentListView = Backbone.View.extend({});
var appointmentListView = new AppointmentListView({collection: appointments});
