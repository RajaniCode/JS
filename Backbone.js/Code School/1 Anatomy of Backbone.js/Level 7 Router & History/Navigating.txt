Navigating


Let's test it out and make sure everything is working.

We've gone ahead and created an instance of our AppRouter below. Use the navigate function to go to appointments/1 and make sure you trigger the route when you do.

ROUTER

var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: { 
    "appointments/:param": "show" 
  },
  show: function(id){
    console.log("heyo we're in show with id %d", id); 
  }
});

APPLICATION.JS

var router = new AppRouter();

Answer:

var router = new AppRouter();
router.navigate("appointments/1", {
  trigger: true
});
