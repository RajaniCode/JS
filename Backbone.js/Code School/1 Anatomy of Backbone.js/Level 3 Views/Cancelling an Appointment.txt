Cancelling an Appointment

Dr. Goodparts is pretty flaky and has been cancelling a lot of appointments lately. He's asked for an easy, one-click way to cancel an appointment in the app you are building.

Add a link to the AppointmentView template that, when clicked, will set its model's cancelled attribute to true.

APPLICATION.JS

var AppointmentView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<span><%= title %></span>'),

  render: function(){
    this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
  }
});
