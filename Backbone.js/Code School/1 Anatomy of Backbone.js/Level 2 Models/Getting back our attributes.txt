Getting back our attributes

We've already seen how we can use get to access attributes on a model instance, but what if we wanted them all at once?

Use the console.log function to log the JSON of the appointment instance using toJSON. If you don't remember how toJSON works, consult the Backbone Model docs.

JS SOURCE
	
var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

APPLICATION.JS

var appointment = new Appointment({id: 1});

Answer:

var appointment = new Appointment({id: 1});
console.log(appointment.toJSON());
