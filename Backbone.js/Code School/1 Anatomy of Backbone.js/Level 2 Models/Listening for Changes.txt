Listening for Changes

Dr. Goodparts is upset that he wasn't notified when we changed his last appointment to cancelled.

Add a listener to the appointment model instance to pop-up an alert box (using alert) whenever any of the model attributes change.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

APPLICATION.JS

var appointment = new Appointment({id: 1});

Answer:

var appointment = new Appointment({id: 1});
appointment.on('change', function(){
  alert('Model attributes changed');
});
