Defaults

Our Appointment model doesn't seem too useful yet. Add two default attributes, title as the string "Checkup", and date which should default to the current time new Date().

APPLICATION.JS

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

Answer: 

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: "Checkup", date: new Date()
  }
});
