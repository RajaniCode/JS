Less Listening

Dr. Goodparts browser crashed because of too many alerts.

Instead of listening for all attribute changes, just listen and alert when changes are made to the cancelled attribute.

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var appointment = new Appointment();

APPLICATION.JS

appointment.on('change', function(){
  alert("Hey Dr. Goodparts, your appointment has changed!");
});

Answer:

var doThing = function(){
  alert("Hey Dr. Goodparts, your appointment has changed!");
};
appointment.on('change:cancelled', doThing);

//Note:
var doThing = function(){
  alert("Hey Dr. Goodparts, your appointment has changed!");
};
//appointment.on('change', doThing);
//appointment.off('change', doThing);
appointment.on('change:cancelled', doThing);
