Set the title

Almost there, but before we display anything let's set the title of the appointment instance! Set it to any string, perhaps something you'd like Dr. Goodparts to take a look at (ex. My Backbone Hurts).

JS SOURCE

var Appointment = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var appointment = new Appointment();

APPLICATION.JS

Answer: appointment.set({title: "My Backbone Hurts"});
