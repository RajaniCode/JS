2.9 Creating Gallery Controller

Now that you're such a whiz with tabbed tab, can you apply what you've learned to our image gallery, too? Don't worry, we'll start slow… And there's a lot more in common than you might think!


1. Let's start with a Controller, just like last time. Call it GalleryController.

Answer:

app.js

  app.controller('GalleryController', function(){
  });


2. Initialize a current property of GalleryController with a value of 0.

Answer:

app.js

  app.controller('GalleryController', function(){
    this.current = 0;
  });

3. Add a method to GalleryController called setCurrent that accepts a value and assigns it to current. If no value is passed in, set current to 0.

Answer:
  app.controller('GalleryController', function(){
    this.current = 0;
    this.setCurrent = function(setCurrent){      
      //this.current = setCurrent ? setCurrent : 0;
      this.current = setCurrent || 0;
    };
  });
