Services give your Controller additional functionality, like ...

Fetching JSON data from a web service with $http

Logging messages to the JavaScript console with $log

Filtering an array with $filter

The $http Service is how we make an async request to a server ...

By using $http as a function with an option object:

$http({method: 'GET', url: '/store-products.json'});

Or using one of the shortcut methods:

$http.get('/store-products.json',(apiKey: 'store-productsKey'));

• Both return a Promise object with .success() and .error()

• If we tell $http to fetch JSON, the result will be automatically decoded into JavaScript objects and arrays

Note: Specifying the services a controller needs (passing service names as arguments) is called Dependency Injection.
